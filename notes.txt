Looking at prof.txt:
main and one_energy taking up the most time, followed by MC_step.
May also look at get_order and all_energy.


testing results from various speedups by comparing to main branch w/out speedups?

copy tests into mpi4py branch and compare to values from mpi4py?

python run_LL.py 10 20 1.0 1 4
python run_LL.py 1000 20 0.2 1 4

cdef cnp.ndarray[cnp.int_t, ndim=2] data
data = np.empty((N, N), dtype=int)

python setup_LL.py build_ext -fi

openmp 

nogil=True: cannot use a lot of python features
run a prange loop with reduction (implicit)


memoryviews better for openmp than numpy arrays.....
