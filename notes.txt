Looking at prof.txt:
main and one_energy taking up the most time, followed by MC_step.
May also look at get_order and all_energy.


testing results from various speedups by comparing to main branch w/out speedups?

copy tests into mpi4py branch and compare to values from mpi4py?

"given system size, we are interested in observing the value of liquid crystal order parameter, S, as a function
of reduced temperature, T*"
- recreate plots

"independent simulations at each temperature, being careful to ensure the system has equilibrated i.e. both the energy and
order parameter should have reached plateaux"
- check for plateau in values

"Average quantities should be determined from the equilibrated parts of the simulations."
